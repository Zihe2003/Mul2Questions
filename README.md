## Dataset discription
  MulRQuestions is **the first large-scale Chinese-temporal** knowledge graph question answering dataset based on the paper "Towards Multi-Hop Reasoning over Dense Temporal Knowledge Graphs".

  Although MulRQuestions is a Chinese data set, its scale is as large as CronQuestions, and it is more dense.
## Dataset example
  If you download the data set you will see that it consists of two parts: **Temporal KG** and **Reasoning QA.** Next, I'll illustrate the data format with an example:
